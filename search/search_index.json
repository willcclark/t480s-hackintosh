Upgraded YogaSMC to stable build 1.3.0 Compatibiltity and improvements on SSDT-Battery . Thanks @benbender Experimental TB3 patch by @benbender: Complete hotplug and power management without modded TB3 controller firmware NOTE: Brokenb USB 3.1 Gen2 hotplug still, but everything else is amazing! Everyone thanks @benbender again! This would not have been possible without his hard work and research. Removed Deprecated legacy keyboard patches. YogaSMC is now recommended and preferred. TbtForcePower.efi as it is no longer needed. ThunderboltReset.kext has it is no longer needed. 2020-11-3 Changed OC to 0.6.3 and upgrade various Acidanthera kexts Restructured docs: depricated legacy things and combined duplicates. YogaSMC is now the preferred method to handle Fn keys instead of ThinkpadAssisstant. Note that YogaSMC is still in its infancy, so you still prefer ThinkpadAssistant, use SSDT-Keyboard-Legacy.dsl and /patches/OpenCore Patches/ Keyboard-Legacy.plist Thank you @zhen-zen for the great kext and app. Updated config.plsit : Removed depricated ACPI renames in accordance with new ACPI patches. Added Arch value to each kext entry in accordance with new OpenCore doc. Added Thunderbolt 3 Device Properties. Added ExtendBTFeatureFlags value to replace BT4LEContinuityFixup Reorganized subdirectories within /patches/ to make things easier to find and understand. Renamed 3_README-POSTinstallation.md to SUMMARY.md since it's not really a step but more of an overview of what patches what. More readble and better writing of SSDT-Keyboard New SSDT-PNLF to accomodate AppleBacklightSmoother.kext New battery patch SSDT-Battery that fixes accesses to 16byte-EC-field HWAC (Issue #82). SSDT-Sleep is an all-in-one sleep patch over SSDT-PTSWAK , SSDT-GPRW , SSDT-EXT* It is no longer necessary to set sleep mode to Linux in BIOS as it is now indepently set by SSDT-Sleep If (_OSI (\"Darwin\")) and SSDT-DTPG are now replaced in favor of SSDT-Darwin and OSDW , just like in genuine Macs. Removed USBPorts.kext in favor of patching/mapping via ACPI with SSDT-XHC1 , SSDT-XHC2 , and SSDT-USBX README.md : Turned different sections into menus for better readability. Merged 3_README-POSTinstallation.md into the SUMMARY section. Set HibernateMode to NVRAM instead of Auto Added update.sh script to automatically build and replace all ACPI patches SSDT-HWAC to patch access to 16byte-EC-field HWAC SSDT-EC to patch embedded controller for use with YogaSMC SSDT-Debug , SSDT-HOOKS , and Debug.plist for debugging if needed SSDT-INIT to configure system values: HPET , DYTC , and DPTF YogaSMC.kext to interface with the device's EC. Make sure to also install the app and pref pane . AppleBacklightSmoother.kext is just as its name implies. BrightnessKeys.kext to handle Fn keys with ACPI renames. Documentation of modding the Thunderbolt 3 controller. Removed SSDT-HPET , similar to genuine Macs, HPET is now disabled within SSDT-INIT 2020-10-6 Notice Just getting back to my rountine and maintaining this project. There has been many developments lately, especially with Thunderbolt 3 ACPI patches and YogaSMC . It will take some time for me to review all these developments and understand them. Meanwhile, it seems @benbender has taken matters to his own hand while I was away :) His experimental fork: https://github.com/benbender/x1c6-hackintosh I will create an issue to specfically to discuss YogaSMC usage and config on this machine. Looking forward, Big Sur is almost here so I want to get this project back onto the latest stable build before it comes out. Changed Support for Hibernation Mode 25. As with normal macOS machines, mode 3 is default, but if you want, mode 25 is now also an option. There seems to be a bug with the GitHub release version of ThunderboltReset.kext so I replaced it one built by @benbender. You can monitor the issue here osy86/ThunderboltReset/issues/7 . Thank you @benbender for noticing this. OC to 0.6.2 Upgraded various Acidanthera kexts as well as VoodooRMI Added Added RTCMemoryFixUp for support of Hibernation Mode 25. OpenCore config patch for FHD Touchscreen. OpenCore config patch for Intel wireless. Removed ALCPlugFix is now deprecated and is replaced by new AppleALC (per issue #75). Please run uninstall.sh from the previous commit to remove ALCPlugFix. Delete legacy DiskImage voice from OC Resources GPRW ACPI patch to fix Bluetooth wake. Make sure that your Wake-on-LAN is disabled in BIOS to prevent sleep problems. Removed advice to disable DPTF in modded BIOS as it can break methods in ACPI. Thanks @benbender SMCSuperIO as it was unnecessary. 2020-8-3 Added Added macOS Boot chime support. Disabled by default, PlayChime to Yes if you want it. Boot chime was upsampled by me using Audacity, will use this upsampled file until AudioDxe.efi can upsample audio on the fly. Changed OC to 0.6 and upgraded various acidanthera kexts. docs/1_README-HARDWAREandBIOS.md : BIOS modding instructions, confirmed working on BIOS-v1.45 . Thanks @benbender for bringing this to my attention. CPU Performance/Battery configuration guidelines. A year and a half after Issue #28 is opened. Thank you to everyone in that issue. Upgraded VoodooRMI , this kext is now stable. Offloaded universally applicable parts of this guide to dortania as referring to their often updated content should be better. config.plist is now defaulted to users with a BIOS mod, those without a BIOS mod will need to add config_unmoddedBIOS.plist to config.plist Enforces modeset to fix Issue #69 2020-7-18 Added EDID Override patch for FHD screen. Thanks @Paolo97Gll Changed By default, OpenCore-EFI now has the 4K output patch disabled for easier system upgrades. Install OpenCore patches/4K-Output if you need it. Upgraded VoodooRMI Documentation changes for readability. 2020-6-29 Added X1 6th Gen Hardware Maintenance Guide pdf. Display Patches in patches/Internal Displays/ for the WQHD HDR Screen: Color profile as calibrated by notebookcheck EDID override to patch HDMI hotplug and overclock refresh rate. Thank you @veelar Please follow instructions on Issue #60 to create an EDID override for your own display. Make sure to create a pull request! Repo issue template to deter low effort issues and better diagnosing and support. More documentation in EFI-OpenCore/README.md about decisions on config.plist Changed Reverted to previous, simpler iGPU framebuffer patches. 2020-6-26 Added VoodooRMI as alternative trackpad option. Enabled by default, feel free to revert back to VoodooPS2Mouse and VoodooPS2Trackpad if you prefer . *Note, there's currently a bug with RMI where the touchpad would not load once in a while. The RMI kext uploaded in this repo has a temp fix by me (See VoodooSMBUS/PR ). However, the issue is still ongoing and the dev team is aware of it. I'm switching this repo to VoodooRMI because I believe it's the future and I want to possible bugs to be reported to be fixed for the kext's first stable release. Kernel patches to enable 4K external graphics, thank you so much @benbender XQ74 patch in SSDT-Keyboard to support FnLock HUD per ThinkpadAssistant 1.8.0 In EFI-OpenCore/README.md , I've added a short section explaining why certain variables are the way they are in my config.plist . I will continue to update this section with more details as time goes on. Changed iGPU Framebuffer patching for HDMI issue in Catalina. In Catalina/WhateverGreen version, for some reasons my previous framebuffer patches for HDMI no longer worked. So I re-did the patch in mode details but eventually the property that fixed it was disable-external-gpu or -wegnoegpu . For some strange reasons, that variable activated on-board HDMI. See similar reports here . I'm going to create an issue on acidanthera/bugtracker soon to report to the dev team. In the mean time, keep this property if you rely on HDMI and do not have an eGPU. Delete this property if you have an eGPU (You're likely using the HDMI on the eGPU anyway). Fixed VoodooPS2 kexts loading order. Various reference docs to dortania. HibernateMode to Auto Removed Unnecessary Mutex OpenCore patches, all Mutex are already 0 in stock DSDT . SSDT-MCHC and SSDT-SBUS for VoodooRMI compatibility. 2020-6-1 Changed OpenCore to 0.5.9 Upgraded various Acidanthera kexts. Recompiled various SSDT with new iasl libraries. Replaced SSDT-EXT3 with SSDT-LED Change SSDT OEM ID to tyler to somewhat track distributions and usage across various projects 2020-5-27 Changed Keyboard backlight is now supported by ThinkpadAssistant 1.7 , thank so much @MSzturc SSDT-keyboard to support ThinkpadAssistant 1.7.0 Honestly, what's even left to improve on the keyboard? Open an issue. 2020-5-24 Added Setting instructions better sleep in 5_README-other.md Changed Bluetooth Toggle is now supported by ThinkpadAssistant 1.6 , thank so much @MSzturc SSDT-keyboard to support ThinkpadAssistant 1.6.0 Removed BetterTouchTool is no longer needed for Fn key functions and has been removed. SMCLightSensor.kext has been removed as the x1c6 has no ambient light sensor. 2020-5-22 Further SSDT-Keyboard tweaks: Windows (mismapped to Left Alt by default) is now properly mapped to Left GUI Left Alt (mismapped to Left GUI by default) is now properly mapped to Left Alt Right Alt (mismapped to Right GUI by default) is now properly mapped to Right Alt This means that Karabiner-Elements is no longer a necessary for this project. Once less program! unless you need it for other purposes (like a hyper key). *Similarly, once Bluetooth toggle is implemented in ThinkpadAssistant, BetterTouchTool can also go away. 2020-5-21 Changed Keyboard Perfection is almost here! - Modified SSDT-Keyboard patch to be compatible with ThinkpadAssistant . - Mute/unMute Microphone with F4, with LED! - Disable WiFi with F8 - Mirror with F7 - Bluetooth, F10 still has to be handled by BetterTouchTool, but hopefully supported will be added soon. See my request 2020-5-9 Changed Upgraded OpenCore to 0.5.8 Upgraded various acidanthera kexts. Fixed various dortania broken guide links. Removed TbtForcePower.efi from LiveUSB OpenCore config.plist Added PM981 install suggestions per Issue #43 Changed ScanPolicy of install_USB to 0. 2020-4-6 (#2) Added Added OpenCanopy to EFI for Picker GUI support.

This is critical when multi-booting, since Windows and Linux do not need the additional patches that macOS does.
